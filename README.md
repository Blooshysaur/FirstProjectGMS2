# FirstProjectGMS2
My first game i've ever used using Game Maker Studio 2.
A little game i made to learn GML (language in GMS). I never finished it since all i was inexperienced and i quickly lost interest in it after making a few levels.

You can use this project for anything you want as long you credit me for the original version.
Feel free to update and make it better if you want to.
